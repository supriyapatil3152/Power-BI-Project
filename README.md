Tool: Power BI Desktop  
To view the visualizations, you'll need to open the file in Power BI Desktop.

Steps to Analyse Your Power BI Project
1.	Data Loading and Preparation:
o	Import Data: Ensure the home loan data is properly loaded into Power BI.
2.	Total Amount Applied:
o	Insight: Identify the years with the highest and lowest amounts applied. Determine if there are any significant trends or patterns over time.
3.	Total Sanctioned Amount:
o	Visualization: Use a bar chart to compare the total sanctioned amount to the total applied amount. This can be done yearly or overall.
o	Insight: Analyse the approval rate over time and determine if there’s a gap between applied and sanctioned amounts.
4.	Total Disbursed Amount:
o	Visualization: Create a funnel to show the flow from application to sanctioning to disbursement.
o	Insight: Understand the efficiency of the disbursement process and how much of the sanctioned amount is actually disbursed.
5.	Recovery Funnel:
o	Visualization: Use a funnel chart to visualize the recovery process from the amount applied to the amount recovered.
6.	Total Amount Applied According to Year:
o	Visualization: Use a map visualization to show geographical distribution and trends in home loan applications.
o	Insight: Determine which branch have the highest and lowest loan applications and see if there are any regional trends.

Key Insights :
1.	Strong Sanction Efficiency: 86.75% of the total loan applications (245K) were sanctioned, indicating high approval rates.
2.	Effective Disbursement: 92% of the sanctioned loans were successfully disbursed, showcasing streamlined processing.
3.	Recovery Challenges: Only 53.24% of the disbursed amount has been recovered, highlighting significant repayment issues.
4.	Product Preference: Loans bundled with group insurance saw the highest application rate, indicating borrower preference for added security.
5.	Significant Drop in Recovery: While 245K was applied for, only 104.2K has been recovered, showing a notable gap in loan repayment. Despite efficient sanctioning and disbursement, with 212.73K sanctioned and 195.71K disbursed, recovery efforts need enhancement.
6.	Online Dominates: Online channels lead with 36.46% of the total amount applied, indicating a strong preference over traditional methods like walk-ins and direct sales agencies.
7.	The  Product-wise Total Amount Applied  reveals that individual insurance loans, with a high total of 61,104, significantly contribute to the overall loan volume, highlighting a major opportunity in this sector.
